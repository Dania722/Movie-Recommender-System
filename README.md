# Movie Recommender System üçøüöÄ

Welcome to the Movie Recommender System project! This system leverages content-based filtering to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences.

## Overview

This project involves:

- **Data Collection:** Gathering movie data from CSV files and extracting essential features like genres, cast, crew, and keywords.
- **Preprocessing Magic:** Cleaning and transforming data, handling missing values, and applying stemming to convert words to their root forms.
- **Feature Extraction:** Utilizing CountVectorizer to create a bag-of-words representation, capturing the essence of each movie's content.
- **Cosine Similarity Model:** Calculating cosine similarity between movies based on their vectorized tags, establishing the foundation for personalized recommendations.
- **Data Serialization:** Saving the final processed data and the similarity matrix using Pickle for seamless deployment.
- **Dynamic Movie Posters:** Integrating The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch eye-catching movie posters dynamically.

## How It Works

1. **Input Movie:** Choose a favorite movie, e.g., "Iron Man 2."
2. **Content Analysis:** The system analyzes genres, cast, crew, and keywords to understand the essence of the selected movie.
3. **Cosine Similarity:** Computes cosine similarity with other movies to recommend those with similar content.
4. **Dynamic Posters:** Enhances recommendations with dynamically fetched movie posters for an immersive experience.

## Key Outcomes

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Recommends movies based on the unique content features of each user's favorite film.
- **Interactive Interface:** Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly experience, allowing seamless interaction with the system.

## Tech Stack

- Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Streamlit, TMDb API

## Results

Successfully achieved accurate movie recommendations, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.
